## Setup
```
1. Get a webhosting or selfhost it (use cloudflare tunnels or any other service)
2. Upload the database folder (if the domain & database folder put together is over 26 characters long, rename the database folder to something smaller)
3. Setup the MySQL database with databass.query.txt and configure config.php
4. Replace the www.boomlings.com/database link inside the .dll/.so/.dylib file to yours using Notepad++ (Windows Notepad will save this as a different format which will crash the mod)
5. Remove the original cvolton.lists.geode from mods/ and unzipped/ folder inside geode and put your modified copy there.
6. Enjoy! If its not reachable then make sure your using a webhosting service that lets you host game servers or apis (any ifastnet service will not work)
```
